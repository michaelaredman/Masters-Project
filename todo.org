** Graph generator -> Preferential unusual/usual regions


*** Make categorical pmf across all 210 regions (unnormed)

*** To select a region select from remaining list with probabilities weighted by the number of neighbours infected

*** After a region is selected remove from possible selection and add 1 to every neighbour


** Graph generator -> Preferential levels of deviation
